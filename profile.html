    <p>I am a junior here at the University of Northern Colorado majoring in Software Engineering and Statistics. I used to play hockey and enjoy playing for fun in my free time every week, but my favorite thing to do is to travel and see new places. Most recently, I had went to the Dominican Republic.</p>
