      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p>Like “grit” itself – the tenacity to show up over and over, to push through the tough times, to better relish the good ones – we offer our players an opportunity to push harder and achieve greater.</p>
      <p>We chose the name Colorado Grit because we believe hockey can create champions both on and off the ice. We strive to develop character as much as skillset in our players while contributing to the community at large. From working with the schools to the Chamber of Commerce, we want Greeley to be as proud to be home of the Grit as we are to call Greeley home. The NAHL brings a level of excitement and exposure to any team’s town, through such events like the NAHL Showcase in September, the NAHL Top Prospects Tournament and the NAHL Robertson Cup Championship, which attracts both NCAA programs and NHL teams.</p>
      <p>We plan on our games being full community events, creating family fun and a source of local pride. And as the only NAHL hockey team in Colorado, the Grit will serve as a professional-development pipeline that offers the widest-possible horizon for our players’ careers. In the league’s own words, “NAHL athletes are provided the opportunity to develop, learn, train, grow and succeed, while playing for free.”</p>
