<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone we look up to—someone who inspires us to believe in ourselves and strive to be our best.For me, Bobby Hull, the legendary hockey player from the 1960s and 1970s, represents that kind of hero. </p>
<p>Though I never had the chance to watch him play, the stories about the kind of player and person he was left a lasting impact on me. His unmatched speed, skill, and passion for the game sparked my own love for hockey.</p>
<p>Growing up outside of Chicago, where the Blackhawks were a household name, hearing about Hull’s electrifying presence on the ice made me dream of playing the sport myself. </p>
<p>He inspired me to lace up skates and play the game, reminding me that heroes aren’t just the ones we see—they’re also the ones whose legacy pushes us to be better, both on and off the ice. </p>
